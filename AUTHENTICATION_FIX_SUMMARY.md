# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved ✅

Your automatic authentication feature is now working! The issue was that the backend server wasn't loading the correct Firebase service account credentials.

## Root Cause

The problem had two components:

1. **Application Default Credentials Conflict**: Your system had Application Default Credentials set to a different Firebase project (`che-message-compliance`) via gcloud
2. **Environment Variables Not Loading**: The backend wasn't explicitly loading the `.env` file, so it fell back to using the system's default credentials instead of your project-specific service account

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Backend Environment Variable Loading

**File Modified**: [`backend/main.py`](backend/main.py)

Added explicit `.env` file loading at the top of the main module:

```python
# Load environment variables from backend/.env
from dotenv import load_dotenv
backend_dir = Path(__file__).parent
load_dotenv(backend_dir / ".env")
```

This ensures the backend always uses the correct service account file specified in `backend/.env`.

### 2. Admin User Setup

**Created User**: `jedwards@che.school` (UID: `VREuQrovBgfFchFsblPRJRbvRUx2`)

Set up admin privileges in Firestore:
- Collection: `users`
- Document ID: `VREuQrovBgfFchFsblPRJRbvRUx2`
- Fields:
  - `email`: "jedwards@che.school"
  - `isAdmin`: true

### 3. Diagnostic Tools Created

Created two helpful scripts for troubleshooting:

- **[`backend/test_firebase_auth.py`](backend/test_firebase_auth.py)**: Comprehensive diagnostic tool that checks:
  - Firebase Admin SDK installation
  - Service account configuration
  - Firebase Authentication API status
  - Custom token generation

- **[`backend/setup_admin_user.py`](backend/setup_admin_user.py)**: Quick tool to create/update admin users in Firestore

### 4. Documentation Created

- **[`AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md`](AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md)**: Detailed setup guide
- **[`QUICK_START.md`](QUICK_START.md)**: Quick reference for starting and testing
- **[`restart_servers.sh`](restart_servers.sh)**: Helper script to restart both servers

## How It Works Now

### Automatic Sign-In Flow

1. User opens http://localhost:5173
2. [`AuthGuard.tsx`](frontend/src/components/AuthGuard.tsx) renders the login form
3. On mount, the `useEffect` hook (line 97-106) automatically triggers the dev sign-in
4. Frontend calls `GET /auth/dev-token?email=jedwards@che.school`
5. Backend generates a custom Firebase token for your user
6. Frontend uses Firebase Auth SDK to sign in with the custom token
7. App checks Firestore for `isAdmin` flag
8. User is redirected to the dashboard!

### Security

The auto-login feature is **development only**:
- Only works when `import.meta.env.DEV === true` or `VITE_ENABLE_DEV_SIGNIN === "true"`
- Backend `/auth/dev-token` endpoint checks `ENVIRONMENT` and blocks production requests
- In production, users must sign in with Google OAuth or Email/Password

## Testing

### Current Status: ✅ WORKING

Both servers are running:
- **Backend**: http://localhost:8000
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173

### To Test

1. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
2. You should be automatically signed in as `jedwards@che.school`
3. You'll have access to the admin dashboard

### Manual Testing

If you want to test manually:

```bash
# Test auth endpoint
curl 'http://localhost:8000/auth/dev-token?email=jedwards@che.school'

# Should return:
# {"token": "eyJhbGciO..."}
```

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `backend/main.py` | Added explicit `.env` file loading |

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/test_firebase_auth.py` | Diagnostic tool for Firebase Authentication |
| `backend/setup_admin_user.py` | Admin user setup tool |
| `AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md` | Detailed setup documentation |
| `QUICK_START.md` | Quick start guide |
| `AUTHENTICATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` | This file |
| `restart_servers.sh` | Server restart helper script |

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after restart:

### Backend Not Starting

```bash
cd backend
python test_firebase_auth.py
```

This will diagnose any Firebase Authentication issues.

### Frontend Can't Connect to Backend

Check that `frontend/.env.local` has:
```
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000
```

### Wrong Project Being Used

If you see errors about `che-message-compliance` project:

1. Make sure backend is running from the project root:
   ```bash
   cd "/path/to/che-data-integrity-monitor"
   uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
   ```

2. Check that `backend/.env` has:
   ```
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="data-integrity-service-account.json"
   ```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Authentication is working
2. ✅ Auto-login is functional
3. ✅ Admin access is granted

You can now:
- Access the full dashboard
- Run integrity scans
- View Airtable schema
- Monitor data health

Enjoy your working authentication! 🎉
