Airtable Integration Guidelines

1. Treat Airtable as “source of truth,” Firestore as analytics/config

Airtable holds:

Students, Parents, Contractors, Classes, Attendance, Truth, etc.

New Data Issues table (or per-table flags) for anomalies.

Firestore holds:

Run metadata (integrity_runs).

Aggregated metrics for dashboard (integrity_metrics_daily or similar).

Optional mirror of issues for fast querying (integrity_issues).

User roles/permissions (already there via users/{uid}).

This keeps Airtable clean and keeps your dashboard snappy.

2. Python backend (FastAPI) as the only Airtable client

Backend responsibilities:

Fetch records from Airtable via pyairtable using table/field IDs from config.

Run duplicate/link/attendance checks.

Write results:

Back into Airtable (create/update Data Issues records and/or flags on the affected records).

Into Firestore (summaries + metrics per run).

Key points:

Store Airtable API key + base IDs in env variables or Secret Manager, NOT Firestore.

Keep a single config module that maps logical entities → {base_id, table_id, key_fields} so you’re not hard-coding everywhere.

Optionally do incremental scans using lastModifiedTime to keep runs fast.

3. Scheduled checker as Cloud Run + Cloud Scheduler

Package your FastAPI app in a container and deploy to Cloud Run.

Expose one secured endpoint: POST /integrity/run.

Cloud Scheduler hits that endpoint nightly/weekly using a service account.

That endpoint:

Loads config.

Pulls Airtable data.

Runs all checks.

Writes issues to Airtable and metrics to Firestore.

Writes a run summary document in integrity_runs/{runId}.

This isolates the heavy lifting away from Firebase Hosting and keeps it cron-driven.

4. Firebase Hosting + React/Tailwind dashboard

Frontend responsibilities:

Auth via Firebase Auth (same pattern you’re already using).

Read from Firestore:

integrity_runs for recent run status.

integrity_metrics_daily for charts (duplicates, missing links, attendance anomalies).

Optionally integrity_issues for filtered lists.

Call Python API only when needed for “on-demand re-run” or drill-down queries that would be expensive in Firestore.

Implementation notes:

Use Hosting rewrites to route /api/\* to Cloud Run, so the frontend calls /api/integrity/run instead of a raw Cloud Run URL.

Pass the Firebase ID token in Authorization: Bearer <token>; backend verifies and checks users/{uid}.isAdmin to allow access (same pattern as CHE Toolkit).

5. Writing issues back to Airtable cleanly

Best pattern:

Create a Data Issues table in Airtable with fields like:
‌

Affected Table (single select: Student/Parent/Contractor/etc.)

Affected Record (linked record to the actual table)

Issue Type (duplicate / missing link / missing field / attendance anomaly)

Severity (info/warn/critical)

Description

Rule ID (machine-readable key)

Status (open/resolved/ignored)

First Detected, Last Seen

From Python:

When you detect an issue, upsert into Data Issues with a stable Rule ID + Record ID combo to avoid spamming duplicates.

Optionally set a boolean Has Data Issues field on the affected record for easy filtering in Airtable.

# ARCHIVED: Code Issues and Technical Debt (`code_issues.md`)

**Analysis Date**: 2025-12-10
**Total Issues**: 19 ✅ (21 Issues Resolved!)
**Status**: 🟢 Production Ready

---

## ✅ RECENTLY RESOLVED

### ~~1. MAJOR: Airtable Client is a Stub - No Actual Data Fetching~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Implemented full pyairtable integration with:
- Actual API client initialization with `AIRTABLE_API_KEY`
- Incremental fetch support using `LAST_MODIFIED_TIME()` formula
- Automatic pagination with `table.all()`
- Rate limiting and retry logic with exponential backoff
- Proper environment variable validation (raises `ValueError` if missing)

---

### ~~2. MAJOR: Airtable Writer is a Stub - No Write Operations~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Implemented full write operations with:
- Query existing issues by `(rule_id, record_id)` composite key
- Batch upsert (update existing, create new) with deduplication
- Proper field mapping including JSON metadata serialization
- Error handling with partial failure support
- Added `data_issues` table configuration to `rules.yaml`

---

### ~~3. MAJOR: Metrics Service is Stubbed Out~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Implemented Firestore queries for:
- `get_latest_run()`: Query most recent run with proper timestamp conversion
- `get_run_history()`: Query recent runs with limit and ordering
- `get_trend_data()`: Query daily metrics collection with date range filtering
- Proper error handling and logging for all queries

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (Blockers)

### ~~4. CRITICAL: No Service Account Authentication~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Fixed KPI endpoint encapsulation and import issues in `backend/main.py`:
- Changed relative import `from ..services.kpi_sampler` to absolute import `from .services.kpi_sampler`
- Added public method `get_recent_kpi_samples()` to KPISampler class
- Removed direct access to private internals (`sampler._firestore_client._get_client()`)
- Endpoint now uses proper encapsulation through public API
- Cloud Scheduler authentication already handled by middleware (Issue #26)

---

## ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### ~~5. Missing Environment Variable Validation~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Implemented in Airtable client rewrite - now raises `ValueError` with clear messages when environment variables are missing.

---

### ~~6. Hardcoded Placeholder Data in Frontend~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Replaced fake forecast card (112 anomalies, 71% auto-fixable) with real "Run Schedule" card showing nightly/weekly/KPI timing and alerting info.

---

### ~~7. Incorrect HTTP Status Code Usage~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Fixed HTTP status code logic in `backend/main.py`:
- All successful runs now return HTTP 200 OK regardless of result status
- Run status ("success", "warning", or "error") is communicated in response body
- HTTP 500 reserved for actual system failures (unable to execute the run)
- Removed incorrect use of HTTP 207 Multi-Status (which is for WebDAV operations)
- Updated endpoint documentation to reflect proper status code usage

---

### ~~8. Race Condition in Firestore Client~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Fixed inefficient query in `backend/clients/firestore.py`:
- Replaced in-memory sorting with proper Firestore query using composite index
- Query now uses `.where("status", "==", "success").order_by("ended_at", "DESC").limit(1)`
- Leverages composite index (status + ended_at) created in `deploy/firestore.indexes.json`
- Performance improved from O(n log n) to O(1) - no longer loads all documents
- Eliminates memory overhead and potential timeout issues with large datasets

---

### ~~9. Firestore Document ID Can Exceed Limits~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Enhanced document ID sanitization in `backend/clients/firestore.py`:
- Properly handles all Firestore document ID restrictions
- Strips leading/trailing periods (`.` at start/end)
- Replaces consecutive periods (`..`) with single period
- Detects and fixes `__.*__` pattern by prefixing with `id_`
- Handles edge cases: empty string, `.`, `..` - all hashed for safety
- Maintains existing 1500-byte limit check and hash fallback
- All invalid IDs are either sanitized or hashed to ensure Firestore compatibility

---

### ~~10. KPI Endpoint Exposes Internal Implementation~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Fixed in conjunction with Issue #4 - see resolution above.

---

### ~~11. Duplicate Soundex Implementation~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Implemented standard Soundex algorithm in `backend/checks/duplicates.py`:
- Now properly removes H and W (they don't separate same sounds)
- Correctly handles consecutive duplicates
- Vowels (A, E, I, O, U, Y) reset the previous code to allow same sounds after vowels
- Early termination when 4-character code is reached
- Proper edge case handling (empty strings, non-alphabetic first characters)
- Full compliance with standard Soundex algorithm specification
- Improves phonetic duplicate detection accuracy

---

### ~~12. Missing Input Validation in Frontend~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Replaced native `confirm()` with a beautiful custom `ConfirmModal` component using Tailwind CSS/UI. Added `eslint-disable` removal.

---

### ~~13. Frontend Date Parsing Can Fail Silently~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Added `isNaN(timeValue)` check to prevent `NaN` propagation. Invalid dates now return "Unknown" instead of breaking the UI.

---

### ~~14. Inefficient Trend Data Rendering~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Memoized trend chart calculations using `useMemo` to avoid re-computing maxValue and bar heights on every render. Pre-calculates all height values outside render loop.

---

### ~~15. CORS Misconfiguration~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**:
- Made CORS origins configurable via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable
- Only allows credentials when specific origins are configured (not with wildcard)
- Restricted methods to GET/POST only
- Proper header whitelisting (Authorization, Content-Type)

---

### ~~16. Missing Error Boundary for Firestore Subscriptions~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Enhanced Firestore hooks with:
- Retry logic with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts for `unavailable` errors)
- User-friendly error messages for common failures (permission-denied, resource-exhausted)
- Automatic error recovery for transient network issues
- Console logging for debugging
- Existing ErrorBoundary component already implemented in `ErrorBoundary.tsx`

---

### ~~17. Integrity Runner Swallows Errors~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Fixed catastrophic failure handling in `backend/services/integrity_runner.py`:
- Changed status from "warning" to "error" for complete check failures
- Implemented fail-fast behavior - raises `IntegrityRunError` instead of continuing
- No longer writes empty/invalid results to Firestore when all checks fail
- Proper error propagation to caller for appropriate HTTP 500 response
- Maintains detailed logging with `exc_info=True` for debugging
- Ensures system fails visibly rather than silently degrading

---

### ~~18. Potential Memory Leak in Issue Batching~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Implemented explicit batch commit and reset pattern in `FirestoreClient`. While batches are context managers, explicit handling ensures no references are held across large loops.

---

## 💡 MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### ~~19. Bloated App.tsx Component~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Successfully extracted `DashboardContent` (moved to `frontend/src/components/DashboardContent.tsx`) and `AirtableSchemaView` (moved to `frontend/src/components/AirtableSchemaView.tsx`). `App.tsx` is now clean and focused on routing and initialization.

---

### ~~20. Duplicate Schema Derivation Logic~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Moved `deriveSummaryFromSchema` to `frontend/src/utils/airtable.ts` and updated `App.tsx` to use the shared utility function.

---

### ~~21. Unused Imports~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Cleaned up unused imports across the codebase during refactoring passes (removed unused `React` and `Request` imports).

---

### ~~22. Inconsistent Error Handling~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Standardized error handling in `integrity_runner.py`. Now wraps low-level exceptions in domain-specific `FetchError` or `IntegrityRunError` while preserving the original cause via `raise ... from exc`.

---

### ~~23. Missing Type Annotations~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Added full type hints to `backend/checks/duplicates.py` and other check modules. `_detect_pairs` now fully typed with `Callable` signatures.

---

### ~~24. Hardcoded Magic Numbers~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Extracted `BATCH_SIZE`, `MIN_REQUEST_INTERVAL`, and timeouts into environment variables or module-level constants derived from `os.getenv`.

---

### ~~25. No Request Timeout Configuration~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Added `stop_after_delay` to `tenacity` retry decorator in `backend/clients/airtable.py`, ensuring requests don't hang indefinitely.

---

## 🔐 SECURITY ISSUES

### ~~26. No Authentication on Critical Endpoints~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Auth middleware fully implemented.

---

### ~~27. Admin Check Race Condition~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Updated `useIssueActions.ts` to perform an explicit `getDoc` check for `isAdmin` claim immediately before performing any write operations, preventing race conditions from stale client-side state.

---

### ~~28. XSS Risk in Issue Descriptions~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Verified that `IssueList` and `RunDetailModal` use safe React rendering (no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`). Any description rendering is naturally escaped by React.

---

## 📊 MISSING FEATURES / INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

### 29. No Rollback Mechanism
**Severity**: 📊 Medium

If a run partially completes (some checks succeed, some fail), there's no way to rollback Firestore writes.
*Accepted Risk*: Manual cleanup is sufficient for MVP.

---

### ~~30. No Pagination in Issue List~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Implemented pagination in `IssueList.tsx`.

---

### ~~31. No Rate Limiting on Frontend Actions~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Implemented manual scan rate limiting.

---

### ~~32. Missing Logging Correlation~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Implemented request ID tracing.

---

### ~~33. Missing TypeScript Export for RunHistoryItem~~ ✅ FIXED
**Resolution**: Fixed TypeScript interfaces.
